</h2>
<p>
  This lab was all about getting my first Express server up and running, and honestly it felt very official. I learned how to initialize a Node project with npm and then added Express (which is kinda like the backbone of cool web servers). I also used VSCode to test everything and fixed a super annoying MIME error. Oh and I added a second route with query parameters which felt like magic when it actually worked. It was like—"wow, I’m actually making something real now."
